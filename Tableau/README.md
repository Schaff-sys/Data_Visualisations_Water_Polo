# **Tableau Dashboard: Club NataciÃ³ AtlÃ¨tic Barceloneta - Champions League Analysis**  

## **Overview**  
This Tableau dashboard provides a detailed analysis of **Club NataciÃ³ AtlÃ¨tic Barceloneta's** performance in the **Water Polo Champions League** for the **2023/24** and **2024/25** seasons. It visualizes key team and player statistics, offering insights into defensive contributions, errors, and power play effectiveness.  

## **Dashboard Features**  

### **1. Interactive Dashboard (Main View)**  
- Displays all key visualizations in one consolidated view.  
- Includes a **player filter**, allowing users to focus on individual performances.  

### **2. Defensive Actions Bar Chart**  
- Highlights **key defensive actions** performed by players, including blocks, steals, and interceptions.  
- Allows for comparison of defensive contributions across the team.  

### **3. Player Wastage Analysis**  
- Identifies **players with the highest wastage value**, calculated as:  
  \[
  \text{Wastage} = \text{Balls Lost} + \text{Fouls Conceded}
  \]  
- Helps assess players' decision-making and discipline in matches.  

### **4. Power Play Contribution Pie Chart**  
- Displays **players who contributed most to power plays** (exclusions drawn, assists leading to power plays, etc.).  
- Suggestion for improvement: **Limit displayed players to those who scored 5+ goals** for clearer insights.  

## **How to Use the Dashboard**  
1. **Filter by Player**: Use the interactive filter to analyze individual player performance.  
2. **Explore Defensive Contributions**: Identify key defensive players through the bar chart.  
3. **Analyze Wastage**: Review which players have the highest error rates.  
4. **Examine Power Play Contributions**: Understand which players are generating key offensive opportunities.  

## **Future Improvements**  
- Refine power play contribution visualization by **setting a goal threshold (5+ goals)** to filter out less relevant players.  
- Add match-by-match breakdowns to track performance over time.  
- Introduce **advanced filtering** (e.g., by match or opposition).  

## **Getting Started**  
1. Open the Tableau `.twb` or `.twbx` file in **Tableau Desktop**.  
2. Ensure the dataset is correctly loaded.  
3. Interact with filters and visualizations to explore the data.
